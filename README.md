# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Movies to Watch 2.0 by Dallas Marshall

A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of *Movies to Watch*.


# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
I would say that the entire project took me around 25 hours start to finish to complete.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I am most satisfied with the GUI interface, coming into this assignment I had a very limited knowledge of kivy and was struggling to grasp the concept. But, now that the assignment is complete it's very satisfying to see my hard work and patience studying examples and the practical pay off.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
The part of this assignment that I am least satisfied with would have to be the error checking for adding a movie. It is the best way I could get it to work however, it still seems very low level to me if,if,if etc. Feels like there could be a better, more readable way, but I have not discovered it. 

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
The answer of what worked well during the development process could simply be that I followed the recommended work flow: Movie, MovieCollection, A1 Re-Write, then Kivy. I see how this could have not gone as smoothly if I had of done it otherwise. Also, working on issues before bed had my brain subconsciously thinking about it while I slept and I would usually wake up with an idea on how to fix the issue.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
Remembering to commit to GitHub is an area I need to work on. I have found myself getting 'on a roll' and writing too much between commits and have really worked hard on remembering not to get carried away on this second assignment (happened once or twice) but definitely an improvement from A1.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
The main resource I used to really 'crack' this assignment was the Kivy Demos, I did also read through a chunk of the kivy documentation to get my head around a few things that were not quite explicit however, having these demos was critical to understanding Kivy. The Drink and DrinkList files also were a big help in getting started as I felt quite overwhelmed at how to start but once I got the first few lines down I was off. Other than these I also refrenced: Programming Patterns, Kivy and Class lectures / Practicals, used Slack a couple times when I became 'stuck in a rut' for an extended period of time.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
My main challenges in this assignment were: Adjusting the window size of widgets without the black space appearing (Had to resort to Slack to overcome this), Getting the movies to load from the file correctly (Overcame by simply seeing what worked and what didn't and using that and many re-writes of code to eventually get a solution). My main issue was the colouring of the buttons as I couldn't find an example of colouring buttons anywhere and ended up spending alot of time trying to decipher kivy errors to see where my issue was but eventually got to where it is today. I also encountered many small hurdles along the way and had to use an array of problem solving skills to solve including: thinking where I had done this before, finding similar solutions and seeing what was common and could apply to my situation and simply creating a copy of code that didn't work, deleting it and coming back another time refreshed to start again when I was not as drawn to one way of thinking.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
Classes not only make code much easier to read and write, they have been a feature I have really enjoyed using as you are able to create a custom solution for the problem you have at hand rather than having to try and make an existing, and sometimes limited solution work for your application. The use of methods also makes code more high level when somebody is reading it as they are able to keep track of what is happening easier (in my opinion).
